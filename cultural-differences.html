        <div class="post"><p>I'm on my way back from a small trip to Lisbon, where i attended part of
a Portuguese Google Technology Users Group, hosted by Google/Paul
Kinlan, presenting Google Chrome Webstore features. The whole event
looked yummi.</p>
<p>Since i'm from Porto, which is 320km/3h (slow/cheaper) train away from
Lisbon and $things have been rough, i wasn't intending on showing
up, but since i got an e-mail from the organization (or someone
close) to drop by and present something on the developers panel (which
i'm thankful for), i decided to code something up related to the event,
minimally interesting,while in a way representing our Northern developer
community.</p>
<p>So, i started coding a Google Chrome, extension to chart browser process
resources in realtime, since last wednesday, using Dojo 1.6 features and
Chrome's experimental API's, which ended up being not that bad.</p>
<p>The event was supposed to start around 7pm, so i took a train and
arrived at about 6.30pm. The last train back home was at 9.30pm and
since i couldn't afford to stay over, i've had asked before and live at
the event today, to bunk at someone's couch, with no replies, so i had
to take the train back.</p>
<p>Most people started showing up at 7.15/7.30pm and Paul Kinlan's talk at
about 8pm, when most of the people were at the venue, so i was only able
to attend about 40m of Paul's talk, which was great.</p>
<p>So, basically, i spent most of my last savings and 6h on traveling,
about 6/8h working on the tech demo, because people weren't kind enough
to let me drop on their couch for one night.</p>
<p>I'm not saying that people are forced to do anything. Probably there
wasn't even that possibility. And it wasn't a total loss, i learned a
few stuff on the way, i always do, tech and socially/community wise.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you another story. Last year i competed at NodeKO, for
which i used Dojo as a UI toolkit and was invited by a Sitepen's
management team, Dylan, to attend a miniconf in London, talk about the
project and Dojo's use in it. Cash wasn't also abundant at the time, but
i really wanted to be there, get to know London, the developer
community, have a nice time and learn new stuff.</p>
<p>Since Dylan invited me to bunk at his bunker, you know, because i was
low on resources and spent a lot of meaningful cash on the trip, i
bought the plane tickets, took off and had a great time.</p>
<p>Other than that, i've even had invitations to bunk at Internet/freenode
people's bunker a few month's to code on projects, in the Silicon
forking Valley.</p>
<p>I've had guests from New York at my (old) place, which where
acquaintaces of acquaintaces of freelance partners of mine over the net,
 that i hardly knew but trusted the referrals, which i took in my own
home and toured them around the region a couple of full days.</p>
<p>It pisses me off, not feeling any kind of support in my own forking
country.</p>
<p>At a tech level, most of the hacker communities, at least around coding
languages (Java, Python, etc) are dead. Most people don't give a damn.</p>
<p>Maybe i'm overreacting, or just acting like a kid or a wave short of a
ship wreck but all i feel like saying to people around here is "take
your nose off your own butt and get real".</p>
<p>Rant over.</p></div>
